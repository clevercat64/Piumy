// Gating por nivel (F4-DESIGN §3) — the middleware that enforces
// anti-leakage for caution/danger dispatches: enumeration tools are fully
// unavailable, and every chat-scoped tool is pinned to the dispatch's own
// chat. A boss-level dispatch (an explicit dispatch with Level ==
// LevelBoss, never the absence of one — F4b) is unrestricted by design.
//
// T170 (supersedes F4b's default DENY; Citrino confirmed C1 on
// 2026-09-29): a terminal with NO live dispatch — none, or one already
// consumed — is denied nothing but set_kill_switch; gating only holds
// while a caution/danger dispatch is alive. Tools with no chat concept at all (get_status,
// get_decision_policy, the 4 gate tools) were never part of this gating
// and stay open regardless — requiring a dispatch just to read the queue
// depth would gate harmless reads for no anti-leakage benefit.
//
// send_to_boss (send_to_boss.go, T39, ct-2026-08-08-1619) joins that same
// exemption, but it's the first one with a real side effect (it sends) —
// deliberate, not an oversight. Never add it to bossOnlyTools/
// enumerationTools/chatScopedArg below: it has no destination argument (the
// owner's chat only, store.BossJIDs()) and resolves its caller from the
// connection, not a parameter — see that file's own doc for why that makes
// it safe here.

//
// What's left is the ONE lock the boss himself asked to keep (his own

// always allowed; only liberating needs an active boss dispatch; is_boss/
// the type tier are never MCP-settable, not even by the principal) —
// that can't live in a name→bool map. Their own handlers (admin_tools.go)
// enforce it directly, which also closes the hole this middleware's
// principal bypass (below) otherwise left open: verified live (Citrino,
// 2026-07-30) that a non-principal-aware bypass let ANY MCP caller on the
// principal terminal rewrite rules/is_boss with zero gating — S12 found
// the identical shape on approve_draft. Putting the check in the tool
// handler itself means it holds regardless of what this middleware

//
