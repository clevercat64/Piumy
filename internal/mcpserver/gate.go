// The gate state machine — the hard gate CLAUDE.md #4 requires in code,
// not in a skill/prompt: locked -> get_instructions(nonce) -> unlock(token)
// -> noting -> remember|skip -> ready -> send_message consumes it.
//
// State is tracked per dispatch (per nonce), never a global flag, so two
// dispatches never step on each other. Correlating later calls
// (unlock/remember/skip/send_message, none of which carry the nonce) to the
// right dispatch is by terminal_id (F4b — not MCP session ID as F4a had it:
// capipush registers a dispatch knowing only the destination terminal_id,
// never an MCP session, which doesn't exist yet at registration time).
// get_instructions(nonce) both binds the calling terminal to that dispatch
// AND validates the dispatch was actually registered FOR that terminal —
// this is what makes it impossible for terminal B to consume a dispatch
// meant for terminal A, even with the right nonce. send_message adds its
// own belt-and-suspenders chat-match check on top (see server.go).
